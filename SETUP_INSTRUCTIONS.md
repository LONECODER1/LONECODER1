## ⚙️ Required Setup

### Important Notes:
- **GitHub Followers Badge**: ✅ Already working! Uses shields.io public API, no token needed
- **Metrics Generation**: Requires METRICS_TOKEN (one-time setup below)
- **Snake Animation**: Uses GitHub's GITHUB_TOKEN (automatic, no setup needed)

To make the metrics generation work, you need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token:

### Steps to Create METRICS_TOKEN:

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Or directly visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens

2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"

3. Give it a name like "GitHub Metrics"

4. Select the following scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `read:user` (Read user profile data)
   - `read:org` (Read org and team membership, team discussions)
   - `read:discussion` (Read team discussions)

5. Click "Generate token" at the bottom

6. **Copy the token** (you won't be able to see it again!)

7. Go to your repository settings:
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/04shubham7/04shubham7/settings/secrets/actions
   
8. Click "New repository secret"

9. Name: `METRICS_TOKEN`
   Value: Paste your personal access token

10. Click "Add secret"

## 🚀 Triggering the Workflows

### Metrics Workflow (`main.yml`):
The metrics will be generated automatically:
- **Daily** (every day at midnight UTC) - ensures your data is always up to date!
- On every push to main/master branch
- Manually via Actions tab → Metrics workflow → Run workflow

After the first run, the `github-metrics.svg` file will be created and displayed in your README!

### Snake Animation Workflow (`snake.yml`):
The contribution snake animation will be generated:
- **Daily** at midnight UTC
- On every push to main/master branch  
- Manually via Actions tab → Generate Snake Animation → Run workflow
- Output stored in `output` branch

**Note**: The snake animation may take a few runs to generate properly. Be patient! 🐍

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Metrics not generating**:

   - Check workflow run logs in Actions tab
   - Ensure token has required permissions

2. **Snake animation not showing**:
   - Wait for first workflow run to complete
   - Check if `output` branch was created
   - May take multiple runs to generate properly

3. **Badges not loading**:
   - Check internet connectivity
   - Verify username in badge URLs is correct
   - Some services may have rate limits

4. **Stats showing incorrect data**:
   - Stats cache may take time to update (usually 24 hours)
   - Try using `&cache_seconds=1800` parameter in URLs
   - Clear browser cache
